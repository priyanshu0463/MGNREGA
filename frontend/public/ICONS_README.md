# PWA Icons

This directory needs two PNG icon files for the PWA manifest:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can:
1. Use an online icon generator
2. Create with design tools (Figma, Photoshop, etc.)
3. Use government logos or MGNREGA branding

The icons should:
- Be square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Have transparent or white background
- Represent MGNREGA or government services
- Be clear and recognizable at small sizes

Once created, place them in this directory and the PWA will use them automatically.
